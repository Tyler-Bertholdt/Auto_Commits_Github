# Meet Your Auto-Commit Assistant

This handy little script keeps an eye on your dotfiles (or any folder you choose) and takes care of Git commits for you—so you don’t have to remember!

### **How It Works!**

- **Watches Like a Hawk:** It monitors your folder for any changes—whether you’ve created, modified, or deleted files.
- **Pauses Before Acting:** After spotting changes, it waits for a set amount of time (like 30 seconds) to make sure you’re done editing. No more half-finished commits!
- **Asks for Permission:** Once the timer’s up, it’ll pop up a friendly notification asking if you’d like to commit those changes.
- **Commits & Pushes:** With just a tap, it stages, commits, and pushes your changes—all automatically.

### Why You’ll Love It

- **No More Forgotten Commits:** Never lose track of changes again.
- **Saves Time:** No manual `git add`, `git commit`, or `git push`—just sit back and relax.
- **Customizable:** Adjust the timer or folder path to fit your workflow.

### Perfect For

- Developers who hate repetitive Git tasks.
- Anyone managing dotfiles or config folders.
- People who want a smarter, simpler way to handle version control.

*Let the script do the heavy lifting while you focus on what matters most!*
